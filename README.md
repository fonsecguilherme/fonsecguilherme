# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme Fonseca, I am 27 years old I am currently living in Brazil.

I am graduated in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL - Campus Arapriaca) since 2021. I have been using Flutter and Dart as my main stack since 2019 and I collected more than 1 year of professional experience as a Mobile Flutter Developer. Today I am looking for new opportunities to show all the experience I collected through since 2019 to be best developer I can. Also, I am expanding my stack to native iOS development and hope to show some projects in my Github in the future. =)

## Skills
- Mobile Flutter development using Dart.
- Version control with Git.
- Automated tests (unit, widget, BLoC...).
- API integration
- State management with BLoC, Cubit, ChangeNotifier and ValueNotifier
- Use of desing tools for references such as Zeplin and Figma
