# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guilherme Fonseca, I am 29 years old I am currently living in Brazil.

Since 2020, I have been using with Flutter and Dart as my main stack and since then, collected more than 2 year of professional experience as a Mobile Developer. I worked in projects related to finances (banks and private companies) and outsourcing companies, working directly with clients to collect feedback.

Hope some time in the future I can share some projects here in my profile =)
